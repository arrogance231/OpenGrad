# OpenGrad roadmap

OpenGrad proceeds from infrastructure to controlled measurement. A later phase is not considered successful without reproducible evidence and regression analysis.

## Completed pre-GPU foundation

0. Repository and research infrastructure — COMPLETE
0.5. CPU-only pre-experiment validation — COMPLETE
1. Data source audit and provenance registration — COMPLETE
2. Canonical normalization and quarantine policy — COMPLETE
3. Accessible corpus materialization, overlap, contamination, and coverage audits — COMPLETE
4. Exact Qwen3.5-2B rendering and token audit — COMPLETE
5. Frozen held-out evaluation preparation — COMPLETE

Current evidence:

- 213,951 canonical valid SFT records across the current accessible sources.
- 210,874 tokenizer-rendered SFT candidates; 3,077 LoopTool records remain explicit renderer exclusions because they contain no user query.
- xLAM and BUTTON are now materialized and included in the corpus audit.
- The frozen held-out evaluation contains 3,952 records.
- No model inference, training, or model-quality result exists yet.
- Canonical dataset publication architecture — PREPARED; upload not run.

## Publication milestone

Canonical dataset publication — CANONICAL_DATASET_PUBLISHED

`arrochi112/OpenGrad-ToolPolicy-Canonical-v1` is public and verified at Hub commit `bb295d8a4ad64f7e8161044ad2fa34f873ede418`. The release contains 213,951 legally cleared canonical SFT records. xLAM is included under CC BY 4.0 with attribution and APIGen citation; its upstream access gate is not reproduced downstream. Publication metadata is recorded in `reports/releases/toolpolicy-canonical-v1-publication.json`.

## Next empirical sequence

6. B0 unmodified Qwen3.5-2B baseline inference — READY / NOT RUN
   Run `Qwen/Qwen3.5-2B` at the pinned revision against the frozen behavioral held-out evaluation.

7. Freeze B0 evidence and generate the residual profile — REQUIRES B0
   Preserve the exact output, evaluator, renderer, generation configuration, and failure taxonomy.

8. Decide and run the controlled SFT comparison — NOT STARTED
   Compare M0 source-oriented control, M1 behavior-balanced hypothesis, and M2 residual-driven mixture only after B0 evidence. M2 requires a real residual profile and remains unresolved.

9. Full post-SFT evaluation and diagnosis — NOT STARTED

10. Preference optimization or on-policy distillation — CONDITIONAL
    Run only when a measured residual justifies the objective.

11. Cross-model replication — PLANNED

12. Quantization and runtime evaluation — PLANNED

13. OpenWeights-derived downstream deployment studies — PLANNED
    OpenWeights is an independent project; its observations motivate hypotheses but are not OpenGrad results.

14. Speculative decoding and inference research — PLANNED / GPU_REQUIRED
    Future comparisons may include autoregressive decoding, external draft speculation, Medusa, EAGLE-3, DFlash, DSpark, and native MTP where supported. No method is currently benchmarked or supported by OpenGrad.

15. Joint capability-efficiency optimization — PLANNED

The dependency order is intentional:

B0 baseline
    -> frozen baseline evidence
    -> residual profile
    -> M0/M1/M2 decision
    -> SFT
    -> post-SFT evaluation
    -> conditional preference/distillation
    -> quantization/runtime
    -> OpenWeights device validation
    -> speculative decoding
    -> joint capability-efficiency studies
